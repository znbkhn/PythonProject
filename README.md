<h1>Welcome!</h1>
This is my first ever Python project and I decided to make a website blocker. 

<br>
<br>

As someone who struggles with focus, I find myself browsing shopping sites & social media far too often, and so instead of working on building up my level of self-control, I figured I'd just make a website blocker that'd do the job for me

<h2>The Plan</h2>
The websites I often get absorbed in are; CultBeauty, ASOS, NastyGal, Liberty, BeautyBay, Twitter, Instagram & Netflix.
To make it easy for myself as it is my forst project, I'll start by blocking 3: ASOS, CultBeauty & Netflix
